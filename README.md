# Clone Repo

Raycast Repo Cloner is a simple raycast extension which helps to automate the tedious task of working with a repo. Instead of navigating to a familiar directory, you can just set a default parent directory and editor by default. 

Once you've done so, you can open any repo in your chosen editor by copying a Github URL and then running the raycast extension.
